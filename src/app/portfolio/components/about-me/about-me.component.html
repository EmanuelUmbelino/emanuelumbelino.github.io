            Hi, my name is Emanuel, I'm a Brazilian programmer. I'm {{ calculateAge(birthDate) }} and I'm an Angular expert!
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg">
            I've been studying programming since 2014 when I started a technical Gaming Programming course. Afterwards, I graduated in Computer Science at one of the most renowned private universities in Brazil, with a full scholarship.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg">
            During my graduation, I interned at IBM, where I had my first contact with Angular. I joined there in 2018, and we used Angular 8 at that time.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg">
            Since then, I've had several jobs, all using Angular.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg">
            I already have more than 
            <span class="font-bold text-xl ping-text px-1">{{ currYear - 2018 }} years of experience</span>
            with Angular.
